|`Pandas`       | Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://pandas.pydata.org                           |
|`Kats`         | Kats, a kit to analyze time series data, a lightweight, easy-to-use, generalizable, and extendable framework to perform time series analysis, from understanding the key statistics and characteristics, detecting change points and anomalies, to forecasting future trends. | https://github.com/facebookresearch/Kats |
|`Prophet`      | Prophet is a procedure (available in Kats) for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.                                                                                                                           | https://facebook.github.io/prophet/                 |
|`scikit-learn` | Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib Open source, commercially usable - BSD license                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://scikit-learn.org/stable/                    |
|`Statsmodels`  | statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct. The package is released under the open source Modified BSD (3-clause) license. | https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html       |
|`tsfresh`      | tsfresh is a python package. It automatically calculates a large number of time series characteristics, the so called features. Further the package contains methods to evaluate the explaining power and importance of such characteristics for regression or classification tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | https://tsfresh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/           |
|`tslearn`      | tslearn is a Python package that provides machine learning tools for the analysis of time series. This package builds on (and hence depends on) scikit-learn, numpy and scipylibraries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html |
|`PyCaret`      |  PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows. It is an end-to-end machine learning and model management tool that speeds up the experiment cycle exponentially and makes you more productive. | https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret |
